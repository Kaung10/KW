            <h3>Book Excerpt</h3>
            <p>The book opens in 2007 as Will Traynor is leaving his girlfriend, Alicia, in bed and heading out 
                the door for his job as a high-powered financier. Will decides not to take his motorbike, a thrill
                that he normally loves, because it is raining hard. When Will steps into the road to hail a cab,
                he is hit by another cyclist and left unconscious.

                <p>The book then moves forward to 2009, introducing Louisa Clark, a 26-year-old woman with outlandish
                fashion sense living in the tiny village of Bishop's Stortford in Essex, England. Louisa is walking 
                home dejected after hearing that the Buttered Bun caf√© where she has worked for six years has to close.
                Louisa knows that her family sorely needs the money, with her mother Josie stuck at home caring for
                Lou's Granddad, a stroke victim, and Lou's nephew Thomas, the son of Lou's younger
                sister Treena. Lou goes to tell the news to her long-term boyfriend, Patrick, who is busy 
                running laps as he trains for another triathlon. Patrick simply tells Lou to buck up and find a
                nother job.</p></div>
